Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where both input features and output labels are provided. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct output labels for new, unseen inputs. In contrast, unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data, and the algorithms aim to find patterns, group similar data points, or discover hidden structures in the data.
